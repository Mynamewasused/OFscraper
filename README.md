# Intro
This is some quick code I put together to get all your images and videos downloaded from Onlyfans. A few quick disclaimers:
1. I haven't done any testing of the code other than with chrome on a Windows PC.
2. It can crash your browser - sorry!
3. If you have a lot of images and videos to download, the tool will probably take a long time to finish.
4. This code is safe and does nothing except click through your browser and copy links to images. It also cannot be used by users to download model content, it only works on the model side of onlyfans.

If you have questions about it, problems getting it to work, or for anything else, find me on Twitter @helper_tip

If you used the tool and want to show some appreciation, here's a way you can do that!

# How to use it
1. Copy everything from [this page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mynamewasused/OFscraper/main/src/scraper.js)
2. Log into Onlyfans on Chrome.
3. Go to your vault.
4. Hit `F12` on your keyboard, or right click and select `Inspect`
5. There should be a window that opens on the right side of your screen - On the top of that window click the "Console" tab.
6. Paste what you copied and hit `Enter` on your keyboard.
7. The process should start scrolling through your vault and eventually going through all your content. It will probably take quite a while.
8. When it's done, it will download a file called "links.txt" which contains a list of links to all your content for you.

# What to do with the links
1. I recommend using [TabSave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-save/lkngoeaeclaebmpkgapchgjdbaekacki?hl=en) - a chrome extension to mass download from links
    * Note: I have not dug into this extension very deeply, and do not know the author. Please use this with caution and at your own risk. This was just the easiest seemingly trustworthy source I found for mass downloading links.
2. After adding Tab Save to chrome, click on the extension (it should either appear next to your address bar in chrome, or under the menu that looks like a jigsaw puzzle icon).
3. Hit the pencil icon on the bottom left corner of the popup.
4. Paste some links from the links.txt file and hit the download button.
5. If you have a lot of content, definitely divide the links into smaller pieces. I was able to do about 500 at a time, but this will depend on your computer and internet speeds.
6. Make sure you have room in your downloads folder to save everything! Or change Chrome's download directory to somewhere that does.
